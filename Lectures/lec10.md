# Lecture 10

## SDT and Ambiguous grammar

- We discussed the midterm scores
  - the top performers in each question was announced.
  - my advice is for the students to meet together and discuss the midterm exam with each other so they benefit form each other because some of the questions do not have a unique solution.

- Islam Hany presented section 5.4 (Syntax-Directed Translation Schemes SDT)
  - 5.4.1.: Postx Translation Schemes
  - 5.4.2.: Parser-Stack Implementation of Postx SDT's
  - 5.4.3: SDT's With Actions Inside Productions
  - 5.4.4.: Eliminating Left Recursion From SDT's

- Nada presented how the parser deals with the ambiguous grammar (Section 4.8)
  - 4.8.1 Precedence and Associativity to Resolve Conflicts

- This was the last Lecture ... Hooray!!
